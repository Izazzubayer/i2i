# 🧩 Image Processing Workflow – UX Information Architecture

| Step / Stage | Component / Element | Purpose / Function | User Role / Access | UI Behavior / Validation | Data / Content Source | Integration / Dependency | Notes / UX Considerations | Microcopy / Labels | UX Priority |
|---------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------|--------------|
| **1. Upload Stage** | Upload Interface | Entry point for the image transformation process. Allows the user to drag-and-drop or browse for images and optional reference documents (SOPs). | Registered | Accepts multiple image types (.png, .jpg, .webp) and optional PDF/SOP uploads. Real-time validation prevents invalid formats or oversized files. | Local file + Upload Service | File Storage API / Cloud Bucket | Display upload progress and instant thumbnail preview. Provide “Remove” and “Replace” buttons. | “Drag your image here or click to upload” | **High** |
| **1. Upload Stage** | Attachment Section | Optional area for users to include additional context or documents that guide the AI transformation. | Registered | Users can attach or remove one supporting document at a time; tooltip clarifies accepted formats. | Local File | File Validation Service | Encourage PDF or DOC formats for clarity; restrict executable files. | “Attach SOP or prompt file (.pdf, .doc)” | **Medium** |
| **2. Prompt Input Stage** | Prompt Field | Allows users to provide a textual prompt describing desired changes or visual goals. The AI uses this input to generate outputs. | Registered | Plain text field with live word count. Input sanitization removes illegal characters. | Text Input | AI Generation Engine | Keep placeholder instructional; add example prompts. | Placeholder: “Describe what you want to see…” | **High** |
| **2. Prompt Input Stage** | Screenshot Attachment (Optional) | Lets users add a reference screenshot to visually guide the AI in interpreting their prompt. | Registered | Clicking the camera icon opens file selector; preview displays below prompt field. | Local File | Upload API | Compress preview image for fast load. | “Add reference image” | **Low** |
| **3. Processing Stage** | Preview Canvas | Displays uploaded image(s) awaiting AI processing, allowing visual confirmation before generation. | Registered | Shows preview thumbnails with delete icons; disabled during active generation. | Dynamic | Image Processing Service | Include status badges: “Ready”, “Processing”, “Complete”. | “Generating preview…” | **High** |
| **3. Processing Stage** | Generate / Process Button | Initiates the AI image transformation pipeline. | Registered | Button remains disabled until at least one file and prompt are valid. On click, shows loading animation and progress percentage. | Dynamic | AI Engine API / Queue Manager | Include estimated time and cancel option. | “Generate Visuals”, “Processing…” | **High** |
| **4. Processing Feedback** | Progress Indicator | Gives real-time feedback during AI processing to manage user expectations. | Registered | Displays circular or linear loader with percentage and estimated time. | Dynamic | AI Engine API | Keep user informed; avoid perceived freezing. | “Processing 65% — almost there!” | **High** |
| **5. Result Stage** | Output Display (Before–After View) | Allows users to compare the generated image with the original side-by-side. Reinforces the quality of AI enhancement. | Registered | Interactive slider for comparison; hover or tap toggles “Before” and “After” views. | Dynamic | AI Image API | Ensure high-resolution previews and responsive layout. | Tooltip: “Drag to compare Before / After” | **High** |
| **5. Result Stage** | Action Panel | Houses primary post-processing actions such as Retouch, Delete, Approve, Download, and Send to DAM. | Registered | Floating sticky panel; buttons trigger confirmation modals. | Dynamic | DAM API / Storage Service | Group actions logically; disable irrelevant ones during pending tasks. | “Retouch”, “Delete”, “Approve”, “Download”, “Send to DAM” | **High** |
| **5. Result Stage** | Retouch Function | Enables users to refine AI-generated outputs by submitting modified prompts or reference images. | Registered | Opens modal to enter retouch instructions. Supports bulk or single-image editing. | Dynamic | Retouch API | Track all retouch history in activity log. | “Apply Retouch”, “Submit Changes” | **High** |
| **6. Review Stage** | Activity Log | Displays chronological list of every user and system action (upload, process, retouch, approval). | Registered | Updates in real time as actions occur; entries include timestamp, action, and user. | Dynamic | Logging Service | Non-editable; add hover tooltip for detailed info. | “Retouched on Nov 5, 2025 by User A” | **Medium** |
| **7. Approval Stage** | Approve Button | Allows users to finalize selected visuals for export or DAM sync. | Registered | Confirmation modal asks for verification; status changes to “Approved” in system. | Dynamic | Project DB | Lock approved assets to prevent accidental deletion. | “Confirm Approval” | **High** |
| **8. Export Stage** | Download Options | Provides export options for single image or ZIP batch download. | Registered | Opens dropdown to choose format (JPG, PNG, ZIP). Displays progress bar for downloads. | Dynamic | File Server / CDN | Maintain compression ratio to preserve quality. | “Download Selected”, “Download All (ZIP)” | **Medium** |
| **8. Export Stage** | Send to DAM | Sends finalized assets directly to linked DAM systems to centralize storage. | Registered | Button visible only if DAM is connected. Shows success notification after upload. | Dynamic | DAM API | Log transfer results; display link to open in DAM. | “Send to DAM”, “Transfer Complete” | **High** |
| **9. Completion Stage** | Confirmation & Notification | Final stage confirming completion and suggesting next steps. | Registered | Inline banner confirms all actions; system sends confirmation email. | Dynamic | Notification Service / Email API | Include link back to Dashboard or “Start New Project”. | “All images processed successfully!” | **High** |
